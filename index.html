        <h1 class="title">Ivory Trade: from 1800s to now</h1>
        <h5 class="personnel">By Lucia Liu, Hannah Lienhard, and Chloe Wang.</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout history, the human desire for ivory—used in products from jewelry to piano keys to priceless religious art objects—has far outmatched efforts to stop the killing of African elephants for their tusks. Although different government and organizations have implemented many policies throughout the years, the elephant's population is still in sharp decline, because of the conflicts of interests between countries. We want to use the following illustrations to visualize the alarming current situation and call for actions to save this magnificient species from potential extinction.</p>    
        <br>
        <!-- CHLOE START -->
        <p>Let us first look at the history of ivory trade. In the chart below, major ivory trade events are plotted against the elephant's population. Note that this chart starts from 1900 but ivory trade started in the mid-1800s. Before the ivory trade, there were 26 million elephants roaming the African continent. But after 5 decades of the trade, the population dropped to 15 million, shrank 42%.</p>

        <p> In the chart below, each step represents a data point of the recorded elephant population. Each dot represents a major event that happened in that year. Click on each dot to find out the history of ivory trade and learn about what led to today's situation.</p>

        <p>The endangerment of elephants has increasingly become an issue in the world today. Since 2003, a statistic called "Proportion of Illegally Killed Elephants," or PIKE, has been constantly monitored. Organizations estimate the annual PIKE statistic in Africa by locating elephant carcasses in sites all around the country. A carcass can either be from an elephant that died naturally or an elephant that died from illegal human action.</p>
        <p>The pie charts below show the PIKE statistics for Africa as well as the country's separate sub-regions for the years 2003-2016. Below the pie charts is a visualization that illustrates exactly how many carcasses were found and emphasizes the number of elephant deaths that were from illegal human poaching. These numbers were obtained from the organization, Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>

        <p> Elephant Ivory is used for a wide variety of objects. Each of these objects uses up quite a bit of ivory for production, and thus requires killing a certain number of elephants. This graphic is designed to help you learn about the impact of using and purchasing ivory products.</p>
